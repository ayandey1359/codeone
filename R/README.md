In this repository I did Data analysis By R programming language. here I pick a data set Superstore_sales_data , which is available in Kaggle licences: public access. 

with that dataset I did Analysis by applying various methods.and i give them name as a different 
project. 

# project 1 : 
In this project I used the jupyter notebook, with R kernel and import the data set in the environment and did get started: 
in this project my primary focus to clean the data and make me to consistent . 

* but there is one problem I face when ever I start jupyter notebook and start the kernel, and needed to run all the previous code.  it face extremely lagging computing speed . because the file becomes heavy and it's take time and sometimes it crashed. 

* so I switched back to my lovely R studio and do all the project by R markdown YAML language. 


# Project 2 :
In this project I took the same dataset superstore sales data.and do the complete data analysis in the R studio. and in this repository i and in project 2 file i uploaded the raw file ( .Rmd ) .
because it is raw file it may difficult to understand. so I made a HTML file and deploy it by GitHub page.  here is the [link](https://ayandey1359.github.io/Project2/) <output page>


# project 3 : 
Here i applied some my own concept and did it.in this project i took the same dataset ( superstore sales data, public access TRUE ). 

* Here i took that data and seperate it into four dataset according by its characteristics. then store all the dataset in the database ,(I primarily use the MySQL or MariaDB and as a host I used DBeaver).

* after completing all this steps.I install ODBC driver from MySQL community. and go to settings and granted permission of ODBC to ODBC driver. 

* then come back to R studio install some necessary packages
  1. ODBC package (connect database with R studio) 
  2. DBI package ( Sql environment, and run all command) 

after that . i made connection with database and R studio. and start the journey of data analysis .

###### Important link : 
in this repository one file name is Project3.Rmd : which is the main file ( raw ) , which is the 1st part of this project. 
though it is (.Rmd) file so it's may difficult to understand. so i deploy a GitHub to understand all  the steps clearly. 
here is the link :"""""""""""""""""""
and though this project 
 ###### MySQL Extension : 
though this project is not limited in just one single file, because this project have both R + SQL. 
in the sql part I used MySQL to understand, clean ,make it consistent . 
So the link of the sql script is here [link](https://github.com/ayandey1359/portfolio/blob/main/SQL/Project_3_SQL_R_ExtensionScript.sql)
